# Portfolio Website Project

## Project Description

This project is a portfolio website designed to look and function like a terminal interface. The goal was to create a unique and interactive experience for visitors, showcasing my web development skills using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Supabase.

### HTML
- **Banner Section**: Contains the title and introductory message.
- **Command Input Area**: A text input field where users can type commands.
- **Output Area**: A section where the results of the commands typed by the user are displayed.

### CSS
- **Terminal Window**: The main container styled to look like a terminal window with a dark background, light text, and a fixed-width font.
- **Command Line Interface**: The input field and output area are styled to mimic a real terminal.
- **Animations**: Subtle animations and transitions to enhance the user experience, such as blinking cursor and smooth scrolling.

### JavaScript
- **Command Handling**: Capturing and processing user input to mimic terminal commands. This includes recognizing commands like `help`, `whois`, `projects`, etc., and displaying corresponding outputs.
- **Auto-scroll**: Ensuring the terminal window scrolls automatically as new output is added, maintaining the look and feel of a real terminal.

### Supabase
- **Comment Storage**: Use Supabase in order to store comments made by users here
- **Comment Creation**: Enables users to create comments with their name and a short message

### Google Analytics 4 (GA4)
- **Site Visits**: Automatically tracks page views and a `site_visit` event.
- **Conversations**: Tracks comment command attempts, successful comment submissions, failures, and comment feed views.
- **Traffic Sources**: Captures source/medium/campaign attribution via UTM params and referrer data.

### Future Enhancements

- **Additional Commands**: Adding more commands to display additional information.
